# What's next?

You have reached the end of the manual. Congratulations.

We hope F\*ckingNode made your JavaScript developer journey a bit less of a f\*cking headache.

Note "we" should actually be "I", as this is maintained by a single developer (me, Zaka 👋) (open to contributions, as always). Any suggestion and/or feedback is appreciated.

Again, any contribution, suggestion, or feedback, is greatly appreciated. FuckingNode's source code is - as the average JavaScript codebase - not great, and any contribution counts towards making this better.

This project was made out of the nowhere and I never expected to focus so much on it and giving it so many features and work. I hope you found it useful.

Thanks for reading this manual until the end. You may now flex about being a Certified Node Fucker (and if this project gets popular enough I will actually start emitting FuckingNode certifications).
